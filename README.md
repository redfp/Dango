# Dango
Minimal configurable HTML startpage created for personal use, inspired by [Bento](https://github.com/migueravila/Bento).

### Goals

- Lightweight but pretty
- Configurable
- Vanilla HTML / JS / CSS
- Responsive design

### Usage

By default, no extra configuration is required. You can change links to your liking by clicking
the button at the bottom of the main page. To change anything else you will need to edit
`js/config.js`, or, if you want to edit styles, `css/styles.css`.
